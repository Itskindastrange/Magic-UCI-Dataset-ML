# MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset (UCI)

This repository contains the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is used for the classification task of distinguishing between gamma and hadron events.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 19,020 instances with 10 real-valued attributes. The attributes represent the various physical properties of the events.

## Files

- `Magic_UCI_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and visualization.
- `magic+gamma+telescope.zip`: Zipped file containing the dataset in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Itskindastrange/Magic-UCI-Dataset-ML.git
    ```
2. Unzip the dataset file:
    ```bash
    unzip magic+gamma+telescope.zip
    ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Magic_UCI_Dataset.ipynb
    ```
